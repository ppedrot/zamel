Zamel is a tool that permits to apply a set of phonetic transformation rules to a given lexicon. It is IPA based, but it also can use any user-provided printing scheme, using conversion rules. The program can be used either with CLI or with a GUI.

It features a rather rich description language for rules that allows to formulate complicated patterns. The general form of a change rule is

    X/Y/A_B

where X is the source pattern, Y the result and A_B the context in which this rule is triggered. That is, whenever a word contains the pattern AXB, it is changed into AYB. For instance:

    l/ʟ/_(<+sb>)[+consonantal-lateral]

This rules indicates that 'l' should be changed into 'ʟ' in front of a consonantal which is not lateral. The (<+sb>) part stands for an optional suprasegmental syllabe break. More example rules can be found in the test/ directory.
